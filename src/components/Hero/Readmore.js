        Ever since the World Geothermal Congress 2020 was postponed last spring, the WGC Organising Committee has been working hard planning a congress in May 2021. However, it has become clear that May this year is not possible either.
  
        In light of this, the Organising Committee has adapted WGC to the new situation we are all facing, while still guaranteeing that WGC 2020 will be an outstanding world class event, where Iceland's knowledge and experience in harnessing geothermal will be at the forefront.
  
        The outcome is World Geothermal Congress 2020+1, a series of monthly virtual events, where over 2,000 papers will be presented, giving the audience to interact with their respective authors and presenters. The highlight of WGC 2020+1 will be a three-day on-site/ hybrid conference in Harpa Conference Centre in Reykjavik, Iceland on 24-27 October 2021, this highlight event will be streamed on-line giving all those of our community that cannot still travel a chance to join the action.
  
        What was planned as a geothermal week in Reykjavik in 2020 will in effect become a geothermal semester, stretching from the virtual opening on March 30 towards the end of October 2021.
  
        The on-site in person event in Reykjavik will be the high point of WGC 2020+1. Turning a spotlight to all the highlights, industry leaders will convene in Harpa Conference Centre to discuss the most outstanding papers, the biggest challenges facing geothermal today and of course, how geothermal can improve its competitiveness and relevance, all the while contributing towards a sustainable and carbon neutral future of energy.
  
        We would like to thank all those registered and especially the sponsors & exhibitors for keeping their commitments with us throughout these uncertain past months. Without them there would have been no WGC 2020+1.
  
        It has been a long and hard journey but we cannot wait to welcome you, on-line and on-site!
